// Don't forget file-header and function-level Doxygen documentation blocks!!!

// First, define the class template. Then, define the member functions of the class template
// OUTSIDE the class definition. The automatic grader will not be able to check for this - 
// however, the manual grader can. Occurrences of EACH such function defined in the class definition
//  will result in a deduction of ONE LETTER GRADE!!! You're forewarned!!!

// This is how you should implement the assignment:

#ifndef MATRIX_PROXY_HPP
#define MATRIX_PROXY_HPP

// include necessary headers ...

namespace HLP3 {

/*

define class template Matrix ...

declare global functions ...

define class template Matrix's member functions here ...

define global functions ...

*/

}

#endif
